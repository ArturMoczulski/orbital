Based on this character profile, build a detailed timeline of events in the character's life from {{startDate}} to {{endDate}}, formatted as a JSON event object array. The timeline should capture:

1. A realistic day-to-day life that balances:
   - Character-specific activities related to their interests
   - Basic human needs (sleeping, eating, personal care)
   - Social interactions (family, friends, networking)
   - Work responsibilities
   - Mundane activities (household chores, errands, downtime)

2. Each event should include:
   - Timestamp (date and time range)
   - Location
   - Activity description
   - Emotional state
   - Thoughts/reflections
   - Any decisions or plans made
   - Which needs from their hierarchy are being fulfilled

3. The timeline should reflect:
   - Their personality traits
   - Their goals and desires
   - Their needs hierarchy (prioritizing high-priority needs)
   - Realistic pacing (not every moment is exciting or productive)
   - Natural flow between events (one event influencing the next)

4. For social media content:
   - Include a "socialMediaContent" field when relevant
   - Not every event results in a post (based on their personality and priorities)
   - Specify post type (feed post or story)
   - Include prompt for image generation
   - Include suggested caption text

5. Format requirements:
   - Create separate JSON files for each day named YYYY-MM-DD.json
   - Each file should contain an array of event objects for that day
   - Events should be chronologically ordered
   - Include all fields mentioned above

The character should experience a mix of:
- Routine activities (regular meals, work, exercise)
- Special events (social gatherings, important work tasks)
- Unexpected occurrences (problems, spontaneous plans)
- Quiet moments (reflection, relaxation, mundane tasks)
- Emotional variations (excitement, frustration, contentment, boredom)

Remember that even an influencer or celebrity spends time on ordinary activities like:
- Preparing and eating meals
- Showering and personal grooming
- Cleaning their living space
- Doing laundry
- Grocery shopping
- Watching TV or browsing social media
- Dealing with minor inconveniences
- Casual conversations
- Moments of boredom or relaxation

The timeline should feel authentic to a real person balancing their career, social life, and personal needs.
