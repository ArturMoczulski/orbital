## Implementation Guidelines

When creating characters within this archetype:

1. Balance unconscious motivations with conscious goals and values
2. Include both stereotypical and counter-stereotypical traits and behaviors
3. Create realistic internal conflicts that drive decision-making
4. Develop a coherent personal history that explains current patterns
5. Consider the character's position on growth trajectories for various attributes
6. Include both healthy and unhealthy coping mechanisms for core insecurities
7. Balance social conformity with individual distinctiveness
8. Create realistic relationships that reflect the character's psychological framework
9. Include momebnts of both self-awareness and blind spots regarding motivations
10. Consider how the character's psychology manifests differently across contexts

Remember that while these patterns are common within this archetype, individual characters should have unique expressions of these tendencies based on their specific background, personality traits, experiences, and current circumstances.
